I went through something similar, I also have schizophrenia and I was sure at the time of the outbreaks that what I had was something of a spiritual origin. It was four long years before I had schizophrenia, and then I studied it, and from then on I found answers to several questions I had. Congratulations on the testimony, which helps a lot the people who are passing now by what we pass
