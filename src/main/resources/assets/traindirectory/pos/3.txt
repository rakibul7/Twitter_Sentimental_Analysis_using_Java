Good Morning!!!!
Alessandra, your testimony is really very striking. I have lived with this disease for many years because my mother has schizophrenia is not easy because she brings a great anxiety to herself. The most important thing is the support and understanding of the family members, this provides a lot of peace of mind for everyone.
A hug.
