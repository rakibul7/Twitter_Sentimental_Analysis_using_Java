Hail Alessandra

Alessandra, a journalism scholar at CEULP / ULBRA is strong, she is a warrior, she is a friend!

Thank you for your confidence in Encena, thank you very much for the critical positions and the conversations we had and will still have.

They are people like you who make me believe in the university as a fundamental space of struggle for dignity and human rights.

We are here for whatever comes!
