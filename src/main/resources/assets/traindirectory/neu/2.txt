I go through a similar problem and also have trouble sleeping. Something that is helping me is listening to music until I fall asleep. I recommend a band called Bond Band, it's classical music. The arrangements occupy my mind in such a way that I gradually disconnect and I can sleep. I hope it helps you too. Cheers...
